					<p style="color: black;">Designed C code to calculate the required time, arrival time, and slack time from the given
						 input matrix file and save the output file separately. Designed a Static Timing Analysis CAD
						  tool GUI using TCL/Tk, which can take inputs from the user and optimize the given input matrix

					<h3><a>Hierarchical Schematic and Layout Design of 4-bit Carry Look-ahead Adder</a></h3>
					<p style="color: black;">Designed a 4-bit CLA adder schematic, Symbol, Testing Circuit, and Layout using Virtuoso. Performed

					<h3><a>1-Bit Ripple Carry Adder Schematic Design and Testing</a></h3>
					<p style="color: black;">I draw the adder schematic using Virtuoso to perform binary addition operation of two bits, which are a and b with an
						 input carry (ci). The delay measurements were performed, and they are found to be as expected value. Then we verified the
						   SPICE netlist against the Verilog module (adder.v) to test the functionalities of the proposed adder. After successfully
						    running ESP, I found to match (passed) and hence the functionalities of the adder were successfully verified.

					<p style="color: black;">I implemented the code to achieve targeted GUI interface and hierarchical gate-level netlist view.
						 I used 16-bit RCA, 8-bit RCA and 4-bit RCA modules for this CAD tool design. The final GUI interface is designed
						  into a five-level hierarchy model which are top-level, first level, second level, third level and Leaf Level hierarchical
						   view. The GUI interface was designed using TCL and the modules were designed using Verilog HDL..

					<h3><a>32-bit Pipelined CPU Design with Modified New ALU Architecture</a></h3>
					<p style="color: black;">Implemented five different 32-bit CPU architectures using standard ASIC flow to achieve desired slack time.
						 Four of them were using CRA, CLA, CSA, and CSeA Adders. The fifth one is with Comparator and CLA adder. 
						Performed RTL Synthesis, Logic Synthesis, PnR, and Post PnR, for each design, and initial slack time and final 
						optimized slack time were recorded with power and area reports. Finally, GDSII Layout files were collected.

					<h3><a>System Level MMP Configuration for Ultra-low Power Optimization</a></h3>
					<p style="color: black;">Designed C code for Graph-based slack time analysis method, then reduced 
						the power consumption of the program using Loop unrolling techniques and measured the power using WATCH tool.
						 To minimize further power, catch optimization technique is used and power measured using the CACTI tool. 
						 Total 85.68% power saving recorded.

					<p style="color: black;">Implemented clock gating techniques like ACG, CCG, OCCG, ECG, LECG and hybrid techniques on a Mobile Multimedia
						 Processor design (MMP) to reduce power consumption by modifying the RTL source code accordingly. With the help
						  of ECG and ACG hybrid model I was able to optimize power up to 109.75%. Formality and ModelSim were used for equality
						   check and synthesis then Power Compiler is used for power measurement.

					<h3><a>High Performance VLSI PVT-Aware Design for 10T SRAM using 15nm PDK</a></h3>
					<p style="color: black;">In order to prevent PVT Variation, I have proposed this 10T SRAM model. I used multiple 
						techniques to optimize process, voltage, and temperature variation. Which are, three Bit Line method, multi VT technique,
						body Biasing technique and transistor Sizing technique. By using all these techniques and designe dy model and performed several
					 transient analysis tests for both READ and WRITE operations. TA tests involve, Rising Propagation Delay, Falling Propagation Delay, Average Propagation Delay, Difference Between Delays, 
					 Rise Time, Fall Time, Dynamic Power, Static Power, Sub threshold leakage Current, Rush Current and Total Power.

						is performed in order to do comparition. The same TA tests were conducted for this model as well. Cadence Virtuoso is used for schematic design and 
						HSPICE is used for netlist simulation. 15nm FinFET PDK tool kit is used to design this model.
